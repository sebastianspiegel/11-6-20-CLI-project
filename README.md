## A Rider-Waite Tarot Dictionary 

A CLI application that uses the Tarot API https://rws-cards-api.herokuapp.com/. 

I made this dictionary for friends that were tired of flipping through tiny booklets, searching for specific cards. This application includes displaying cards by suit, as well as a search function to find cards by name. You can also request a number of randomly chosen cards and give yourself a full tarot reading! 

This application was made through the Flatiron School software engineering immersive. 

## Instalation 

1. git clone to your local machine
2. cd into file
3. `ruby bin/start` to start the program
4. Follow command prompts!
